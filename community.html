            <h2>Join the Global Stop-Motion Family!</h2>
            <p>Stop-motion can feel lonely when you're working frame by frame in your bedroom at 2 AM. But you're NOT alone! Thousands of animators worldwide are on the same journey—learning, creating, struggling with armatures, celebrating finished films, and supporting each other. Our community is your crew, your cheerleaders, your teachers, and your friends. Welcome home, animator!</p>
            <blockquote>
                "Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much. In stop-motion, community isn't just nice to have—it's essential for staying motivated, learning faster, and creating work that truly shines." — Helen Keller (adapted for animators!)

            <p>To keep our community welcoming and productive, please follow these guidelines:</p>
            
            <ul class="info-list">
                <li><strong>Be Respectful:</strong> Everyone starts as a beginner. Offer constructive criticism, not discouragement. Treat others how you'd want to be treated</li>
                <li><strong>Give Credit:</strong> If sharing someone else's work or tutorial, always credit the creator. Plagiarism is not tolerated</li>
                <li><strong>Stay On-Topic:</strong> Keep discussions related to stop-motion animation, filmmaking, or creative pursuits</li>
                <li><strong>No Spam:</strong> Don't promote products or services unless specifically asked for recommendations</li>
                <li><strong>Help Others:</strong> If you see a question you can answer, share your knowledge! Community thrives when members help each other</li>
                <li><strong>Constructive Feedback Only:</strong> When critiquing work, be specific and helpful. "I don't like it" isn't helpful. "The lighting on the left is too harsh, try diffusing it" is helpful</li>
                <li><strong>Celebrate Wins:</strong> Encourage fellow animators! Comment on their work, congratulate milestones, and spread positivity</li>
            </ul>
