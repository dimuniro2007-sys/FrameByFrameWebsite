            <h2>Your Stop-Motion Animation Masterclass</h2>
            <p>Welcome to your complete stop-motion education! These modules transform complete beginners into confident animators. Each lesson builds on the previous one, taking you from "What's a frame rate?" to "I just created my first animated film!" Work through them in order for the full learning experience, or jump to specific topics that spark your interest.</p>

                "Animation is about creating the illusion of life. And you can't create the illusion of life without knowing the life you're creating. Stop-motion is magic—it's making the impossible believable, one tiny movement at a time." — Brad Bird, Oscar-Winning Director

            <h2>Module 1: Stop-Motion Fundamentals - The Magic Behind the Movement</h2>
            
            <p>Before you dive into creating your first animation, let's understand the beautiful science and art behind stop-motion. Once you grasp these core concepts, you'll see movies differently forever—and you'll be ready to create your own magic!</p>
            
            <section class="module-basics">
                <h3>What is Stop-Motion Animation?</h3>
                
                <div class="module-content">
                    <div class="text-content">
                        <p>Stop-motion animation is a filmmaking technique where objects are physically manipulated in small increments between individually photographed frames. When the sequence of images is played rapidly (usually 12-24 frames per second), it creates the illusion of smooth movement.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Key Concepts:</h4>
                        <ul class="info-list">
                            <li><strong>Frame Rate:</strong> The number of individual images shown per second (fps). Standard rates are 12fps (choppy but manageable), 15fps (smoother), and 24fps (cinematic)</li>
                            <li><strong>Frame-by-Frame:</strong> Each position is photographed individually. A 10-second animation at 12fps requires 120 separate photos</li>
                            <li><strong>Persistence of Vision:</strong> The human eye retains images briefly, making sequential photos appear as continuous motion</li>
                            <li><strong>Patience Required:</strong> Stop-motion is time-intensive. A 1-minute animation at 12fps can take 10-20 hours to complete</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul class="info-list">
                            <li><strong>Claymation:</strong> Using clay or plasticine figures (e.g., Wallace & Gromit)</li>
                            <li><strong>Puppet Animation:</strong> Articulated puppets with wire armatures (e.g., Coraline, Kubo)</li>
                            <li><strong>Object Animation:</strong> Everyday objects brought to life (e.g., commercials)</li>
                            <li><strong>Cutout Animation:</strong> Flat 2D pieces moved on a surface (e.g., South Park's early episodes)</li>
                            <li><strong>LEGO Animation:</strong> Using LEGO figures and sets (brickfilms)</li>
                            <li><strong>Pixilation:</strong> Real people as the animated subjects</li>

            <p>Developed by Disney animators Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas, these principles apply to all animation forms, including stop-motion. Understanding them will elevate your work from moving objects to believable characters.</p>

                <h3>Camera Requirements and Setup</h3>
                
                <h4>Essential Camera Features:</h4>
                <ul class="info-list">
                    <li><strong>Manual Mode:</strong> Must be able to lock exposure, focus, and white balance. Automatic settings change between frames, creating flicker</li>
                    <li><strong>Remote Trigger:</strong> Prevents camera shake. Use a wired remote, wireless trigger, or intervalometer</li>
                    <li><strong>Tethering Capability:</strong> Allows viewing on computer screen for precise positioning (ideal but not required)</li>
                    <li><strong>Live View:</strong> LCD screen or viewfinder for composition and focus checking</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Camera Positioning:</h4>
                <ul class="info-list">
                    <li>Mount camera on a sturdy tripod—any movement between frames ruins the shot</li>
                    <li>Position at character eye level for intimate scenes, above for establishing shots</li>
                    <li>Tape down tripod legs to prevent accidental bumps</li>
                    <li>Mark the floor where your tripod sits in case it gets moved</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Camera Settings:</h4>
                <ul class="info-list">
                    <li><strong>ISO:</strong> As low as possible (100-200) to minimize grain. Use more light instead of raising ISO</li>
                    <li><strong>Aperture:</strong> f/5.6 to f/8 gives good depth of field for small scenes. f/2.8 for dramatic bokeh effects</li>
                    <li><strong>Shutter Speed:</strong> Doesn't matter for still images—any speed works. Just keep it consistent</li>
                    <li><strong>White Balance:</strong> Set manually (not auto) based on your lights. Prevents color shifts between frames</li>

                            <li><strong>Key Light:</strong> Main light source, positioned 45° to the side and above subject. Brightest light</li>

            <h2>Module 4: Building Characters and Armatures</h2>
            
            <p>Creating poseable, durable characters is an art form itself. This module covers armature construction, materials, and character design.</p>
            
            <section class="armature-basics">
                <h3>Understanding Armatures</h3>
                <p>An armature is the internal skeleton that allows your character to hold poses. Professional armatures use ball-and-socket joints, but beginners can achieve great results with wire armatures.</p>
                
                <h4>Wire Armature Construction (Beginner-Friendly):</h4>
                <ul class="info-list">
                    <li><strong>Material:</strong> Aluminum wire (1.5-2mm thick) from hardware stores. Strong enough to hold poses but bendable</li>
                    <li><strong>Double Wire:</strong> Twist two wires together for strength. Single wire breaks quickly with repeated bending</li>
                    <li><strong>Proportions:</strong> Arms slightly longer than torso, legs longer than arms. Research human proportions or stylized cartoon proportions</li>
                    <li><strong>Anchor Points:</strong> Drill holes in wooden base and secure wire legs with epoxy putty for stability</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Body Building:</h4>
                <ul class="info-list">
                    <li><strong>Bulk It Up:</strong> Wrap armature with aluminum foil to add mass. Creates foundation for clay</li>
                    <li><strong>Clay Application:</strong> Use polymer clay (Sculpey, Fimo) or plasticine. Polymer clay hardens when baked, plasticine stays soft</li>
                    <li><strong>Thin Layers:</strong> Build up gradually. Thick layers crack when the armature bends</li>
                    <li><strong>Smoothing:</strong> Use rubbing alcohol and soft brushes to smooth surfaces before baking (polymer clay only)</li>
