                <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
                <p>FrameByFrame was created to address a critical gap in accessible animation education. Too many aspiring animators face barriers: expensive courses, scattered information, and equipment recommendations that ignore budget constraints. We believe that creativity shouldn't be limited by financial resources or geographic location.</p>
                
                <p>Our mission is to provide comprehensive, free stop-motion animation education that empowers students and beginners worldwide to master this beautiful art form. We've built this platform as an all-inclusive learning hub where anyone with passion and dedication can develop professional-level skills.</p>
